Note1: please use CSElabs machines (kh4250,kh2170 or lind40) to test my code!

The way to compile

step1: extract my tar file
step2: open terminal, in the file directory, type make
step3: put the execute peer file to the folder peer1 peer2 peer3 ...

(I've already make all the file and put it in the corresponding folder, you don't need to re-compile it.)

The way to run:

For central server, in terminal type
 
	./central-server 20000
In my terminal, it looks like : wang3090@lind40-07 (/home/wang3090/Desktop/csci5211) % ./central-server 20000

For peer:

In directory peer1 (or anyother peer folder), in terminal type

	./peer ~/Desktop/csci5211/peer3 lind40-07.cselabs.umn.edu 20000
	"~/Desktop/csci5211/peer1" is the pathname
	"lind40-07.cselabs.umn.edu" is where the central server runs
	"20000" is the port number

After enter the commond, the central server will show the following result

	new peer join! 0 th node 134.84.62.109

When the second peer B join, 

The connecting peer B will show:

	new peer join! 0 th node 134.84.62.108 with port 20000
	hello my following peer!
	
	(means it successfully connect to A)

The central server will show: 
	new peer join! 1 th node 134.84.62.106 
	r_index is 0 
	
	(r_index means the random picked peer A to connect)

The connected peer A will show

	start accept!!
	request_for_peer_network_connection:20001
	new peer join! 0 th node 134.84.62.106 with port 20001
	
	(means it accept the connection)

In peer commond line

Quit:
	if you want to quit this peer: type "quit" in peer terminal:
	it will show "sucessfully quit!", means this peer succussfully quit the network

	The peer which connect to it will show 
	
		Quit_from_peer_network_connection:20001
		admin: disconnected from '134.84.62.106(20001)'
		find in 0th elements of the table,Delete it!
	
	The central server will show: 

		admin: disconnected from '134.84.62.106(20001)'
		find in 1th elements of the table,Delete it!

List:
	if you want to list the files that this peer have: type "list" in peer terminal:
	it will show 
	doc2.txt  peer
	get the files in the shared list

Get:
	if you want to get the file from another peer, type "get filename.txt" (for example "get doc3.txt")
	After it shows "Ok received from client!", you successfully get the file.
	if it shows "time out", means there maybe no such file in the peer network.

Share:
	if you want to share the file with another peer, type something like"share doc1.txt lind40-08.cselabs.umn.edu"
	After it shows 
		find in 0th elements of the table
		Ok File doc1.txt from host was sent!
	You successfully share the file to other peer.
